solutions:
  - Ferns are considered early colonizers as they grow fast on poor soil and reproduce
    rapidly. Notice the ferns were also reduced in abundance. Although they recovered,
    they did not go back to the previous numbers. Mass extinctions open a window of
    opportunity for surviving species to expand, radiate as they occupy vacated niches.

    "Removing one phosphate groups converts ATP to ADP or ADP to AMP. Removing two phosphate groups converts ATP to AMP. These reactions release 7.3 kcal/mol per phosphate group (or 14.6 kcal/mol for two released phosphate groups). Adding one phosphate group converts AMP to ADP, or ADP to ATP. These reactions require an input of 7.3 kcal/mol per phosphate group added. Reaction 3 shows the addition of a phosphate group to AMP to form ADP, a reaction that requires an input of energy and should read as follows:"
  - Shooting the projectile straight up gives you the greatest height. 90 degrees would
    point straight up and will give you the greatest height.
  - No, we would both view the motion from different reference points because motion
    is viewed from two different points; the reference framesare similar but not the
    same.

  - Humans have altered the carrying capacity of their environment by modifying it to
    produce more food, shelter, and medicines.
  - Veins are parallel in monocots such as corn and form a network in spinach, a dicot.
  - While the massless carrier particles will travel an infinite distance, they will
    spread out from the source. As a result, fewer carrier particles will exist at a
    particular location in space, reducing the total force experienced at that location.
    Because this is a spread in three dimensions, the reduction will be at a squared
    rate.
  - The speed of light in a vacuum is the same in all inertial frames of reference.
  - microRNA
  - Abiotic components influence an environment’s biomass. Plant growth depends on the
    amount of sunlight, water and warm weather available. With a sufficient amount of
    sunlight, water and warm weather photosynthesis can proceed at high rates resulting
    in biomass production. This plant growth also influences animal communities, which
    impact biomass.

  - nervous system
  - Neglecting the effects of air (resistance and buoyancy), the only other external
    force acting on an object in freefall is its weight. Thus, the net external force

  - has a better shelf life
  - Griffith’s experiment demonstrated bacterial transformation, a process in which
    external DNA is taken up by a cell, thereby changing morphology and physiology.
    He showed that hereditary information could be transferred from one cell to another
    “horizontally,” rather than by descent. This is also the only conclusion that can
    be made from the experiment with the new bacterial species. There is no evidence
    from this experiment regarding the identity of the molecule that carries hereditary
    information.
  - Bacterial species are living, which makes it biotic factor.
  - Natural science is concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding
    of natural phenomena, based on observational and empirical evidence while computer
    science is the logical and practical approach to computation.
  - when there is no heat transfer of energy to the environment
  - The chain is not extended any further.

    Phagocytosis is the process by which large particles are taken in by a cell. For example, when microorganims invade the human body, monocytes and neutrophils will remove the invaders through this process, surrounding and engulfing the microorganism, which is then destroyed by the immune cell.
    Mast cells don’t directly engulf cells; they release histamine, which recruits macrophages, which in turn use phagocytosis to remove microorganisms.
  - Colors with shorter wavelengths bend more.
  - The DNA will have few methyl groups.
  - The kidneys can be divided externally and internally into three layers. Externally,
    the kidneys are surrounded by three layers. The outermost layer is a tough connective
    tissue layer called the renal fascia. The second layer is called the perineal fat
    capsule, which helps anchor the kidneys in place. The third and innermost layer
    is the renal capsule. Internally, the kidney has three layers. An outer cortex,
    a medulla in the middle, and the renal pelvis in the region of the kidney called
    the hilum.

    The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can’t be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed.
    The second law of thermodynamics states that that no energy transfer is completely efficient and tends toward disorder.
    Entropy is the measure of randomness or disorder within a system, whereas heat is the energy transferred from one system to another that is not work.

  - Formal education involves a set of rules and procedures and a fixed routine for
    the day.
  - The traits are probably linked.
  - glucose; ATP
  - Specific ranges of parameters (such as ion concentration and body temperature) need
    to be maintained in the body, which negative feedback promotes. Positive feedback
    would result in excessive production of actions stimulated by hormones such as growth
    and blood glucose levels.
  - DNA replication would not occur
  - Wavelength
  - BMR increases with body size Larger animals have higher overall BMRs because they
    require more energy to maintain their size. However, smaller animals have relatively
    higher BMRs per body weight because they have greater surface area for their mass.

  - The cells responsible for bone resorption are osteoclasts. Osteoclasts are large
    bone cells with up to 50 nuclei that remove bone structure by releasing lysosomal
    enzymes and acids that dissolve bony matrix, helping with the regulation of the
    blood’s calcium concentration. The dissolved bone material may also be resorbed,
    a process important during bone remodeling.
  - Phagocytosis
  - Animals that don’t have true tissue level organization are placed in the subkingdom
    Parazoa. Parazoa contains only one phylum – Porifera. Phylum Porifera consists of

    where spongin is present and spicules maybe present or absent.
  - Physics provides an understanding of how radiation works and how to construct a
    device that emits it.
  - Multicellular organisms must coordinate many different events in different cell

    The blackberries will likely prevent the seeds of native trees from germinating, reducing the population of native trees.
    The number of salmon in runs will be monitored before the removal of blackberries because it is the baseline and every year after removal because native trees must have time to grow tall enough to give shade. (Restoration of the streambank would include removal of sediments.)
  - The liver assists in fat digestion by producing bile, which breaks down fat.
  - Gases and liquids are considered fluids. Thus at room temperature, air, mercury,
    and water are fluids.
  - tonsils
  - The lowest-frequency resonance is called the fundamental, whereas all higher resonant
    frequencies are called overtones. Collectively, they are called harmonics.
  - The potential energy will increase as nuclei approach, due to the repulsive Coulomb
    force. However, that potential energy will rapidly decrease once a peak is passed,
    as the attractive nuclear strong force takes hold.
  - Different receptors respond to different molecules. In the case of nicotinic and
    muscarinic receptors, they can respond to acetylcholine.
  - DNA polymerase is able to add nucleotides only in the 5’ to 3’ direction. One strand,
    which is complementary to the 3’ to 5’ parental DNA strand, is synthesized continuously
    towards the replication fork because the polymerase can add nucleotides in this
    direction. This continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand.
    The other strand, complementary to the 5’ to 3’ parental DNA, is extended away from
    the replication fork, in small fragments known as Okazaki fragments, each requiring
    a primer to start the synthesis. The strand with the Okazaki fragments is known
    as the lagging strand.

  - The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for response to emergency situations
    via “flight or fight” response and can cause increased heart rate.
  - Photosystem II and cellular respiration
  - Adding soap or oil to water reduces the surface tension, so the water striders would
    be less able to stand, walk, and run on top of the water if soap were added. Whether
    they would drown or not would depend on the amount of soap added.
  - Even though the lens has a greater index of refraction, the greatest amount of refraction
    occurs as light moves from air into the cornea because the difference in indexes
    of refraction is greatest at that boundary.
  - Since acceleration depends on velocity, we know that it must have a magnitude and
    direction associated with it. Therefore, acceleration is a vector quantity.
  - Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown, launched, or projected into
    the air.
  - is a uniaxial hinge joint
  - No; since velocity is a vector, you need to know direction in order to determine
    it. A speedometer describes speed but not direction.
  - Not necessarily; if both are thrown at different angles, they will travel different
    distances.
  - Having different types of innate immune responses allows the body to fight off many
    different types of pathogens. Not all pathogens are alike, and different pathogens
    will be deterred by different types of immune responses. Having both immediate and
    induced immune responses allows the body to have a way to immediately begin fighting
    an infection as soon as the pathogen enters the body and then to have alternative
    responses that are induced and go to work a bit later in case the immediate responses
    are not completely effective.

  - Reverse transcriptase is needed to make more HIV-1 viruses, so targeting the reverse
    transcriptase enzyme may be a way to inhibit the replication of the virus. Importantly,
    by targeting reverse transcriptase, we do little harm to the host cell, since host
    cells do not make reverse transcriptase. Thus, we can specifically attack the virus
    and not the host cell when we use reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
  - Population genetics is the study of how selective forces change the allele frequencies
    in a population over time.
  - False; the formation of pure standing waves would require perfect alignment of very

    toward the end in the colon, where it moves semi-solid waste through the colon.
  - The amount of energy associated with the unification of the strong and electroweak
    forces is significantly greater than that needed for the creation of the electroweak
    force.
  - These would most likely include the physics involved in the functioning of any living
    system.
  - The three methods of heat transfer are radiation, convection, and conduction. Condensation
    and evaporation can occur due to heat transfer, but they are not methods of transferring
    heat.

  - the collective action of individuals working together in an attempt to establish
    new norms beliefs, or values
  - The momentum of a singular photon is incredibly small. While there are many photons
    striking you at any time, their combined momentum remains incredibly small.
  - Yes; average velocity depends only on the displacement and the time interval. The

  - The food web is balanced. If a top predator disappears (foxes, wolves, the primary
    consumers (caribous, hares) multiply without restriction, over-graze the producers
    (lichens, grass), and must migrate to avoid starvation. Some top consumers cull
    the herds of the weakest members or clean the environment by scavenging dead remains.
  - High frequency wavelengths are more likely to be emitted than low-frequency wavelengths.
    As a result, the blackbody curve will increase in energy intensity as the wavelength
    decreases. However, as the frequency increases, the amount of energy necessary to
    provide this frequency will increase. While this will result in a continued increase
    in intensity, eventually a tipping point is reached at which the photons created
    are too few for intensity to continue to increase. This will result in a decrease
    in energy intensity as wavelength decreases to very low numbers.
